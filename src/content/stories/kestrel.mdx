Identity: Vera Kivan - Former Republic Intelligence / Current ISB Analyst

Vera Kivan died on Empire Day. The woman who wore her name afterward was someone else. Someone who smiled in meetings while memorizing which officers skimmed funds. Someone who filed reports that were technically accurate but fundamentally misleading. Someone who had learned that the best place to hide from monsters was inside the monster's mouth.

She had been Republic Intelligence. Senior analyst. Fourteen years of service. Specialized in pattern recognition and network analysis. The kind of person who saw connections others missed. The kind who could track a smuggling ring through shipping manifests or identify sleeper cells through communication patterns. Good at her job. Proud of her work. Loyal to the Republic.

The transition to Imperial service was automatic. Same desk. Same terminal. Different letterhead. They told her nothing had changed except efficiency improvements. They told her the Emperor would bring order. They told her to continue her work. She did. For three days.

On the fourth day, she was assigned to process Order 66 aftermath reports. Jedi bodies. Clone testimonies. Temple security footage. Her job was to identify Jedi who might have escaped. Track possible survival patterns. Create target packages for Inquisitors.

She watched younglings die on security feeds. Counted bodies. Catalogued lightsaber burns. Filed it all under "Successful Pacification Operations." That night, she went home and threw up until her stomach was empty. Then she made a decision.

Vera Kivan would continue to exist. Would show up for work. Would file reports. Would attend briefings. Would be a model Imperial Intelligence analyst. But she would also be something else. A ghost in the machine. A virus in the system. A small rebellion wearing a single face.

She started simple. A shipping manifest altered by one digit. A criminal record that developed corruption errors. A surveillance file that accidentally copied over itself. Small things. Testing the system's tolerance for imperfection. Learning what she could touch without triggering alerts.

The Republic had taught her how to track criminals. The Empire was teaching her how to be one.

She chose the name Kestrel for her other self. A small predator that hunted from patience rather than power. Never used it on any system. Never wrote it down. Never said it aloud. It existed only in messages that deleted themselves. In connections that formed between people who never met. In patterns only she could see.

Her ISB work gave her perfect cover. She was supposed to track anomalies. Find connections. Identify threats. So she did. She found every corrupt officer. Every skimming operation. Every unofficial detention center. Every black-site prison. She filed reports on all of them. Accurate reports. Complete reports. Reports that somehow never quite led to actionable intelligence.

Meanwhile, Kestrel sent messages. A clone who needed his records scrubbed. Done during routine database maintenance. A droid whose medical logs could expose him. Corrupted during a scheduled backup failure. A pilot whose ship was marked for impound. Inspection routes adjusted for "efficiency optimization." All of it technically within her authority. All of it invisible if you did not know where to look.

She built her network slowly. Assets who owed her. Assets who did not know they were assets. Assets who thought they were working for a crime lord or a Rebel cell or a mysterious benefactor. She gave them what they needed. They did what she needed. Nobody knew anyone else existed.

The ISB promoted her twice. Excellent pattern recognition. Superior analysis. Exceptional loyalty metrics. She smiled at the irony. They were measuring her ability to hide from herself. Every promotion gave her deeper access. Every commendation gave her more authority. Every success at being Vera Kivan made Kestrel stronger.

She found CT-6113's records during a routine clone deserter sweep. The inhibitor chip removal was hidden but present. The medical droid's involvement was obvious if you knew what to look for. They would both be terminated if caught. Unless someone helped them disappear. Unless someone needed assets with their particular skills.

She found Tekli's ship in an impound alert file. Modified beyond regulations. About to be seized and stripped. The Chadra-Fan was talented. The modifications were artistic. Worth preserving. Worth recruiting. A few keystrokes. Different inspection routes. Ship saved. Pilot grateful. Asset acquired.

She found Bill through Temple archives she was not supposed to access. Padawan names cross-referenced with physical descriptions from refugee reports. Bilar Saruun. Young. Zabrak. Last known location matched a freighter crew manifest. The Force-sensitive was hiding well but not well enough. He needed better cover. She provided it. She also provided hope that his master might live. The transport records were real. Whether the master lived was unknown. But hope was a powerful leash.

Each asset was chosen carefully. Skills that complemented each other. Personalities that would work together without becoming too close. All of them wanted to hurt the Empire. None of them could do it alone. Together, properly directed, they could be surgical instruments.

The courier mission was eighteen months in planning. She had identified the black-site network through pattern analysis of supply requisitions. Found the data courier through communication protocols that were too clean. Traced the route through fuel consumption reports that did not match official flight plans. The courier carried prisoner transport records. Force-sensitive acquisition lists. Black-site locations. Everything the Empire wanted hidden.

She needed that data. Not for the Rebellion, though they would eventually receive copies. Not for justice, though justice might result. She needed it because her daughter's name was on one of those lists.

Maya had been seven when she made a toy float across her bedroom. Vera had seen it. Had held her. Had promised to keep her safe. Had sent her to live with her grandmother on Alderaan. Far from Coruscant. Far from the Empire's center. Far from her mother who worked for monsters.

But the Empire's reach was growing. The Inquisitors were getting better at finding Force-sensitives. The black-sites were expanding. Maya was eleven now. The toy floating had become objects moving when she was emotional. Her grandmother's last message had been carefully coded but clear: the child was developing abilities that would soon be impossible to hide.

Vera could not extract her daughter without exposing herself. Could not warn her directly without creating a trail. Could not protect her while wearing an ISB uniform. But Kestrel could. Kestrel could burn the black-site network. Could corrupt the Force-sensitive databases. Could create enough chaos for one child to disappear into the confusion.

The assets were in place. The *Hunter's Mark* crew for extraction. The *Credit Risk* crew for technical support. The Y-wing for cover. All of them owing Kestrel enough to follow orders. None of them knowing why the mission really mattered.

After the mission, Vera Kivan would continue. Would file reports. Would attend briefings. Would be a model ISB analyst tracking patterns that never quite formed. Would smile while documenting Imperial victories that somehow always had gaps. Would be promoted for excellent work that accomplished nothing.

And Kestrel would continue too. More assets. More operations. More small rebellions that looked like criminal activities. More cuts that would not kill the Empire but would make it bleed. Drop by drop. File by file. Asset by asset.

She sat at her ISB terminal. Surrounded by colleagues who would execute her if they knew. Reading reports about brutality she was supposed to enable. Planning operations that would save lives while appearing to do the opposite. Being two people was exhausting. Being two people was necessary. Being two people was the only way to be the mother Maya needed while working for the Empire that wanted to take her.

The courier mission would launch soon. Her assets would perform their roles. The data would be extracted. The black-sites would be exposed. The Force-sensitive lists would be corrupted. Maya would disappear from Imperial notice. One child saved among millions suffering.

It was not enough. It would never be enough. But it was what she could do from inside the monster's mouth. For now, that had to be sufficient.

Vera Kivan filed another report. Accurate. Complete. Useless.

Kestrel sent another message. Encrypted. Helpful. Revolutionary.

Both women were the same. Both were different. Both were necessary.

The Empire had created the perfect double agent by assuming loyalty could be measured in metrics. By believing that access meant agreement. By trusting that someone who had served the Republic would serve the Empire with equal dedication.

They were wrong. Vera Kivan served the Empire perfectly. She also destroyed it perfectly. One corrupted file at a time. One saved life at a time. One small rebellion wearing an ISB uniform and a mother's desperate love.

The courier would fly soon. The assets would move. The mission would succeed or fail.

Either way, Kestrel would continue. Until Maya was safe. Until the Empire fell. Until Vera Kivan could stop being two people and become herself again.

If that day never came, at least she had tried. At least she had fought. At least she had hidden her rebellion where the Empire would never think to look: in their own reflection.
