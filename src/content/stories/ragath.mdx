Ragath

The freighter docks on Ord Mantell stretched for kilometers. Ragath learned them all as a youngling, running messages for dock workers who paid in food scraps. Barabel claws made him useful for cargo that needed securing. Barabel teeth made him useful when securing was not enough.

His mother worked the loading crews until her back gave out. His father never worked at all, unless fighting in cantinas counted as employment. Ragath chose neither path. He took protection jobs because they paid triple what loading offered and required less drinking than his father managed.

The first contract was simple. Keep thieves away from a shipment of medical supplies. Stand there. Look dangerous. Collect credits. The thieves took one look at Barabel teeth and found easier targets. The merchant paid in full. Word spread. The lizard who did not start fights but finished them thoroughly.

For three years, the work was steady. Frontier routes where Imperial patrols were suggestions rather than certainties. Merchants who could not afford professional security but could not afford to lose cargo either. Ragath stood watch. Ragath got paid. Ragath sent credits home to keep his mother fed.

The Imperial inspection changed everything. A routine cargo run carrying agricultural equipment. Nothing illegal. Nothing suspicious. The Imperial customs officer smiled while his troopers seized half the shipment. "Regulatory violations," he said. "Improper documentation fees. Administrative penalties."

The merchant showed his permits. All valid. All current. The officer shrugged. The troopers loaded the cargo onto Imperial transports. The merchant could not pay Ragath. Half his goods were gone. The Empire had stolen them legally.

Ragath memorized the officer's face. Memorized the serial numbers on the seized crates. Memorized the docking bay where Imperial transports waited. He had no plan. Just anger that sat in his stomach like spoiled meat.

The message appeared on a public terminal two days later. No sender. Just coordinates and a time. Ragath went armed. The location was an abandoned warehouse. Inside, a single datapad on a crate.

The datapad contained the officer's side business. Shipping manifests with altered numbers. Warehouse leases under false names. Credit transfers to accounts that existed nowhere in Imperial records. The officer had stolen from dozens of merchants. The Empire got its cut. The officer got rich. The merchants got nothing.

The last line of the message: "Balance the accounts if you choose. Kestrel watches."

Ragath chose. The warehouse burned that night. The stolen goods inside it burned too, except for the crates that mysteriously appeared at their original owners' docking bays. The officer survived. His career did not. Internal Affairs received anonymous documentation of his activities. The officer took early retirement rather than face investigation.

A week later, another message: "Clean work. Minimal casualties. Accounts balanced. More accounts need balancing. Standard rates plus operational expenses. Interested?"

Ragath was interested. The jobs came irregularly but paid well. Always Imperial targets. Always corrupt operators working their own angles. A quartermaster selling military rations to slavers. Ragath destroyed the shipment and left the quartermaster tied to a cargo container with the evidence. A port official taking bribes to overlook smuggled weapons. Ragath ensured the weapons were discovered during an "anonymous" tip to regional command.

The work satisfied something beyond credits. Every corrupt Imperial who fell was payment for that first theft. For his mother's broken back. For every frontier merchant ground down by regulatory fiction.

Then Kestrel made an introduction. "YT-2000 needs security specialist. Established crew. Regular routes. Your kind of work."

The meeting happened at docking bay 94. The ship, called the *Credit Risk*, looked like scrap held together by determination. A Chadra-Fan sat in the cockpit making adjustments to controls. A young Zabrak loaded cargo with movements too smooth for a regular dock worker. A Verpine worked on a terminal, compound eyes tracking multiple data streams.

The Chadra-Fan emerged first. "I am Tekli. I fly. You protect?"

"I protect."

"Good. Pirates think YT-2000s are easy prey. We dislike proving them wrong repeatedly. Wastes ammunition. You make them reconsider. We pay standard rates plus percentage of cargo value delivered safely."

"Who chooses the cargo?"

"Kestrel suggests. We evaluate. Usually medical supplies. Food for blockaded settlements. Sometimes other things."

"Other things?"

The Zabrak looked up from his loading. "Things that help people who need helping. Things the Empire says they cannot have."

The Verpine added, "Things with clean documentation that passes inspection."

Ragath understood. Rebels. Or Rebel-adjacent. Or simply people who hated the Empire for personal reasons. The distinction mattered less than the work.

"I join," Ragath said. "When do we fly?"

They flew that day. The *Credit Risk* handled like a drunk bantha, but Tekli made it dance when necessary. Bill, the Zabrak, moved cargo with an efficiency that suggested military training or something similar. Kaa'Reth, the Verpine, kept their records cleaner than medical facilities.

Ragath stood guard when they made deliveries. First one off the ramp. Last one back. His presence prevented most problems. His claws solved the rest. The crew worked well together. No wasted words. No wasted movements. Everyone knew their role.

Three months in, they were interdicted by pirates. Two fighters. One boarding craft. The pirates demanded surrender. Tekli laughed over comms and threw the *Credit Risk* into maneuvers that should have torn it apart. Bill manned the guns with disturbing accuracy. Kaa'Reth jammed the pirates' communications and somehow convinced their nav computers they were somewhere else.

Ragath waited by the airlock with a boarding pike. The pirates never made it that far. Bill's shooting disabled their engines. Tekli flew circles around them until they surrendered. Kaa'Reth wiped their nav logs and sent them toward an Imperial patrol route. The Empire could sort them out.

"Good work," Ragath said afterward.

"We survived," Bill replied. "That is always good work."

The jobs continued. Medical supplies to plague zones. Food to settlements the Empire was starving into submission. Sometimes weapons to people who needed them for defense, not offense. Always Kestrel's suggestions. Always clean enough to pass inspection if they were careful.

Now Kestrel called in all markers. A black-site courier needed intercepting. The entire crew participated or nobody did. Success meant a letter of marque from a friendly planetary government. Legal authorization to operate. No more running from every patrol.

Ragath checked his weapons. The boarding pike was sharp. The blaster was charged. The crew was ready. Whatever the courier carried, the Empire wanted it protected. That was reason enough to take it.

He thought about his mother. Still alive. Still poor. But eating regularly now thanks to the credits he sent. He thought about the corrupt inspector who started this path. Retired in disgrace. Accounts balanced.

Soon there would be more accounts to balance. There always were. The Empire created them faster than Ragath could settle them. But he would try. One corrupt official. One stolen shipment. One balanced ledger at a time.

The *Credit Risk* flew toward the coordinates. The crew prepared in their own ways. Tekli whispered to the ship. Bill meditated in the cargo hold. Kaa'Reth reviewed technical schematics.

Ragath sharpened his claws. Some preparations were simple.
